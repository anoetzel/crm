My job was Front-end (Javascript, HTML, CSS), the back-end (with local DB) and design (Figma) I'd obtained.
## CRM-description
You can:
- create, change or delete a client.
- search the needed client.
- share the link to the client's page.

## How to start the project
Start the backend: `npm run start:backend`

Start the frontend: `npm run start:frontend`
